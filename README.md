# Multivariate Regression
This repository is built for the multivariate regression of measured hydrodynamic forces on a ship model's hull. The coefficients of the multivariate linear regression are derived from the Taylor expansion of hydrodynamic reactions on the ship's hull.

The workflow for regression and validation of applied models is presented in [jupyter-notebook](https://github.com/pciuh/multivariate-regression/blob/main/hull_deriv.ipynb)
